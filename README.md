#Community Board

Community Board

A way for neighbors to connect and converse with each other over the web.

A neighbor can log in to the service and view the various neighborhoods available on the site. Join a conversation on any of the community specific topics or make up one and see other interested neighbors join in on the conversation. They can also carry on the conversation with their favorite neighbors via private chat.

The platform assumes your location and suggests nearby neighborhoods you might be interested in. You can easily select the featured neighborhoods or search for your favorite place.
For future implementations neighbors can select “their” neighborhood and by continued participation will be distinguished as a “local”. In visiting other neighborhoods they will be labeled a tourist until their contributions to that particular neighborhood increase in frequency.
